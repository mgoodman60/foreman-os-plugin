# ForemanOS v5.0

The superintendent's operating system. 7 modular plugins for construction field management, powered by deep document intelligence.

Built for superintendents, not software engineers.

## Plugin Architecture

ForemanOS v5.0 splits the former monolith into 7 self-contained Cowork plugins. Each plugin has its own commands, skills, and agents. Install only what you need.

| Plugin | Cmds | Skills | Agents | Description |
|--------|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| **foremanos-core** | 7 | 6 | 4 | Project setup, data, dashboards, briefings, rendering. Install first. |
| **foremanos-intel** | 2 | 4+1 stub | 3 | Document intelligence, DWG extraction, quantitative takeoffs. |
| **foremanos-field** | 8 | 10+1 stub | 2 | Daily reporting, safety, quality, inspections, labor, punch lists. |
| **foremanos-planning** | 6 | 5+4 stubs | 2 | Scheduling, look-aheads, weekly reports, material tracking. |
| **foremanos-doccontrol** | 5 | 5+2 stubs | 0 | RFI prep, submittals, drawings, annotations, BIM. |
| **foremanos-cost** | 6 | 7+2 stubs | 0 | Cost tracking, EVM, pay apps, change orders, delays, claims. |
| **foremanos-compliance** | 5 | 5+3 stubs | 0 | Risk, environmental, closeout, sub scorecards, conflicts. |

**Totals:** 39 commands, 42 full skills + 13 stubs, 11 agents across 7 plugins.

## Installation

All plugins live in the **foreman-os-marketplace**. Install via Cowork:

```
claude plugin install foremanos-core@foreman-os-marketplace
```

**foremanos-core is required** -- every other plugin depends on it for project data, entity resolution, and the data store backbone.

## A Day with ForemanOS

**6:15 AM** -- Run `/morning-brief` from the truck. Weather is 38F with rain clearing by 10 AM. The system flags 38F is below the 40F minimum for concrete placement per Section 03 30 00. Two deliveries today: structural steel at 7:30, waterproofing membrane at noon. Foundation inspection at 2 PM.

**7:00 AM** -- Steel arrives. Type `/log Walker delivered W12x26 beams to east wing, 14 pieces, good condition`. The system resolves "Walker" to Walker Construction from the sub directory, maps "east wing" to Grid E-G / Level 1, links steel to spec section 05 12 00, and logs quantity as 14 of 47 total beams (30%).

**11:30 AM** -- Walk the foundation forms. Type `/log rebar spacing looks tight in the north footing, grid B-2`. Classified as a quality observation, linked to Section 03 20 00 (ASTM A615 Grade 60), with a hold point inspection flagged before pour.

**3:00 PM** -- Run `/daily-report`. It pulls everything from the morning brief, both log entries, and any photos. Narratives standardized to third person past tense. Photos auto-captioned. Spec references, grid lines, and weather data woven in. Out comes a .docx matching your company template.

**Friday** -- `/weekly-report` rolls up all five daily reports into a polished owner summary. `/look-ahead` generates the 3-week schedule. `/dashboard` shows crew trends, inspection pass rates, and the S-curve.

| **weekly-planning-coordinator** | planning | Orchestrates the weekly lookahead cycle using Last Planner System principles |
| **conflict-detection-agent** | planning | 25 detection rules across 8 conflict categories for cross-discipline discrepancies |

## Skills Architecture

### Full Skills vs. Stubs

Each plugin carries its own **full skills** (SKILL.md plus references/ and scripts/ directories). When a command in one plugin needs methodology from a skill owned by a different plugin, it uses a **stub** -- a SKILL.md-only copy of the canonical source, without the references/ directory.

Stubs are kept in sync by running `sync-stubs.sh` from the repo root after editing any canonical SKILL.md. The script prepends a header comment identifying the canonical source.

**Current stub map:**

| Stub Skill | Canonical Owner | Consumed By |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| project-data | foremanos-core | intel, field, planning, doccontrol, cost, compliance |
| report-qa | foremanos-field | planning |
| document-intelligence | foremanos-intel | doccontrol, compliance |
| estimating-intelligence | foremanos-intel | cost |
| quantitative-intelligence | foremanos-intel | planning |
| submittal-intelligence | foremanos-doccontrol | planning |
| delay-tracker | foremanos-cost | compliance |

### Cross-Plugin Reference Strategy

Plugins reference each other using three mechanisms, in order of preference:

1. **Stubs** -- SKILL.md methodology synced via `sync-stubs.sh`. The command reads the stub like any local skill. Used for foundational skills needed by many plugins (e.g., project-data).
2. **Soft references** -- A command mentions a skill by name and describes what it provides, without requiring the file to be present. The AI resolves these if the other plugin is installed; gracefully degrades if not.
3. **Inlined methodology** -- For agent-level knowledge, the relevant methodology is written directly into the agent definition. Agents are never copied between plugins.

Zero agent copies across the entire system. Zero hard cross-plugin file path references.

## Data Flow

The intelligence pipeline is unchanged from v4.x:

```
Documents (plans, specs, schedule, contracts, sub list, geotech, safety plan...)
    |
    v
/process-docs or /process-dwg  [foremanos-intel]
    |
    v
Three-pass extraction pipeline (metadata -> structural analysis -> targeted content)
    |
    v
28-file JSON intelligence store (in project's AI - Project Brain/ directory)
    |
    v
All downstream commands and agents consume the store
```

### Intelligence Store (28 JSON files)

**Project Core:**
`project-config.json`, `plans-spatial.json`, `specs-quality.json`, `schedule.json`, `directory.json`

**Document & Issue Tracking:**
`rfi-log.json`, `submittal-log.json`, `procurement-log.json`, `change-order-log.json`, `inspection-log.json`, `meeting-log.json`, `punch-list.json`, `delay-log.json`, `drawing-log.json`

**Financial & Labor:**
`cost-data.json`, `pay-app-log.json`, `labor-tracking.json`

**Quality:**
`quality-data.json`

**Safety, Risk & Closeout:**
`safety-log.json`, `risk-register.json`, `claims-log.json`, `environmental-log.json`, `closeout-data.json`, `annotation-log.json`

**Visualization:**
`visual-context.json`, `rendering-log.json`

**Report History:**
`daily-report-data.json`, `daily-report-intake.json`

Every command that reads project data uses entity resolution (sub names, grid locations, spec sections, schedule activities) to enrich raw input with intelligence from the store.

## Supported Document Types

| Document | What Gets Extracted |
|----------|-------------------|
| Plans / Drawings | Grid lines, building areas, floor levels, room schedules, site layout, door/hardware/finish/fixture schedules |
| Specifications | CSI divisions, material specs, weather thresholds, hold points, tolerances, testing requirements |
| CPM Schedule | Milestones, critical path, near-critical, weather-sensitive activities, long-lead items |
| Contract | Key dates, LDs, working hours, documentation requirements |
| Sub List / Bid Tab | Subcontractor directory with trades, scopes, contacts |
| Geotechnical Report | Bearing capacity, water table, compaction requirements, unsuitable soils |
| Safety Plan | Fall protection zones, confined spaces, hot work areas, crane exclusion zones |
| SWPPP | BMP inventory, inspection triggers, documentation requirements |
| RFI / Submittal Logs | Entries with status, references, responses, lead times |
| Vendor Quotes / Product Data | Supplier capabilities, contact info, pricing, certifications |
| AutoCAD DWG / Civil 3D | Survey points, utility structures, contours, property boundaries, grading data (via libredwg) |

## Migration from v4.2

The v4.2 monolith (single `foreman-os` plugin with top-level `commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` directories) has been replaced by 7 self-contained plugins. Key changes:

- **Monolith removed.** The old single-plugin structure (`commands/`, `skills/`, `agents/` at repo root) no longer exists. All content is now inside the 7 `foremanos-*` plugin directories.
- **marketplace.json updated.** Lists 7 plugins instead of 1. Each plugin has its own `commands/`, `skills/`, and `agents/` directories.
- **No command changes.** All 39 commands work exactly as before. Same names, same arguments, same behavior. The only difference is which plugin provides them.
- **Stubs replace cross-references.** Where the monolith had direct file path references between skills, the split uses stubs and soft refs. Run `sync-stubs.sh` after editing canonical skills.
- **Project data is unchanged.** The 28-file JSON store, extraction pipeline, and project memory (CLAUDE.md) are identical. No data migration needed.

### What Stayed Local

The `plugins/` directory still contains 4 **Claude Code-only dev plugins** that are NOT part of the marketplace and NOT for Cowork:

| Plugin | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| foremanos-stack | Prisma 6.7, NextAuth RBAC, Redis caching, SWR fetching, Trigger.dev task patterns |
| foremanos-llm | Multi-provider LLM orchestration, vision pipeline, RAG system, prompt patterns |
| foremanos-testing | Vitest patterns, API route testing, `/test-coverage-report` command |
| foremanos-documents | PDF generation (react-pdf/pdf-lib/pdfkit), Office docs, R2 file storage |

These are development-time skills for the ForemanOS Next.js application codebase. They require Claude Code's execution environment and will cause sandbox mount errors if installed in Cowork.
