# Foreman_OS

The superintendent's operating system. A complete construction field management toolkit powered by deep document intelligence.

## What it does

Foreman_OS extracts comprehensive intelligence from your project documents — plans, specs, schedules, contracts, sub lists, geotech reports, safety plans, and more — then puts that intelligence to work across every part of your daily workflow: daily reports, 3-week look-aheads, RFI/submittal management, weekly owner reports, material tracking, vendor sourcing, and construction schedule generation.

Built for superintendents, not software engineers.

## A Day with Foreman_OS

**6:15 AM** — You run `/morning-brief` from the truck. Weather is 38°F with rain clearing by 10 AM. The system flags that 38°F is below the 40°F minimum for concrete placement per Section 03 30 00. Two deliveries today: structural steel at 7:30 and waterproofing membrane at noon. Foundation inspection is scheduled for 2 PM.

**7:00 AM** — Steel arrives. You type `/log Walker delivered W12x26 beams to east wing, 14 pieces, good condition`. The system resolves "Walker" to Walker Construction from the sub directory, maps "east wing" to Grid E-G / Level 1 from plans-spatial, links the steel to spec section 05 12 00, and logs quantity as 14 of 47 total beams (30%).

**11:30 AM** — You walk the foundation forms and type `/log rebar spacing looks tight in the north footing, grid B-2`. The system classifies this as a quality observation, links it to spec section 03 20 00 (ASTM A615 Grade 60), cross-references the grid location, and flags that this area has a hold point inspection before pour.

**3:00 PM** — End of day. You run `/daily-report`. It pulls everything from your morning brief, both log entries, and any photos you dropped in. Narratives get standardized to third person past tense. Photos are auto-captioned and placed. Spec references, grid lines, and weather data are woven in. Out comes a .docx matching your company template.

**Friday** — You run `/weekly-report` to roll up all five daily reports into a polished owner summary. `/look-ahead` generates the 3-week schedule with sub assignments, material deliveries, and weather constraints. `/dashboard` shows crew trends, inspection pass rates, and the S-curve.

That's the daily loop. Everything else plugs into the same intelligence layer.

## Getting Started

1. **Install and set up** — Install the plugin, then run `/set-project` to configure your project and upload key documents (plans, specs, schedule, sub list, etc.)
2. **Morning brief** — Run `/morning-brief` each morning for weather, schedule, deliveries, and alerts
3. **Log throughout the day** — Use `/log` as things happen on site. Talk naturally; entity resolution handles the rest
4. **Generate your report** — Run `/daily-report` at end of day. It pulls from your logs, standardizes language, and places photos

From there, explore: `/look-ahead` for 3-week scheduling, `/prepare-rfi` for RFI drafting, `/safety` for incident logging, `/weekly-report` for the owner, `/dashboard` for analytics, `/process-docs` when new documents arrive.

## How Project Intelligence Works

When you upload project documents during `/set-project` or `/process-docs`, the plugin runs a three-pass extraction pipeline:

1. **Metadata extraction** — Reads PDF properties (creator app, title, dates) to auto-classify the document type
2. **Structural analysis** — Scans for sheet indices, tables of contents, and table headers to confirm type and guide extraction
3. **Targeted content extraction** — Pulls specific intelligence based on document type, exhaustively — every schedule, every note, every detail

This intelligence is used by every command in the system:

- `/log` resolves sub names, fills in grid lines, adds spec references
- `/daily-report` enriches narratives with locations, thresholds, hold points
- `/look-ahead` maps activities to subs, materials, and weather constraints
- `/prepare-rfi` auto-fills drawing and spec references
- `/submittal-review` pulls spec requirements for compliance checking
- `/material-tracker` verifies deliveries against spec requirements
- `/schedules` generates formatted trade schedules from extracted data
- `/morning-brief` checks weather against thresholds, flags upcoming deliveries

The more documents you upload, the smarter everything gets.

## Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

Foreman_OS generates a `CLAUDE.md` file in your project directory that serves as working memory across sessions. It contains a snapshot of your project basics, current status, key intelligence, active issues, and available commands. This file is auto-updated whenever project data changes, so Claude always knows where things stand when you start a new conversation.
