# Submittal Intelligence Skill

## Overview

The submittal-intelligence skill performs comprehensive compliance reviews of submitted product data, shop drawings, and samples against specification requirements from project intelligence. It automates the verification process by:

- **Extracting spec requirements** from relevant CSI sections with testable, verifiable criteria
- **Parsing submittal documents** (PDFs, data sheets, shop drawings) to extract product specifications and performance data
- **Building a compliance matrix** that cross-references each specification requirement with the submitted value
- **Determining compliance status** for each line item: Compliant, Non-Compliant, Partially Compliant, or Unable to Verify
- **Generating professional review comments** suitable for architect/engineer review cycles
- **Producing an overall recommendation**: Approved, Approved as Noted, Revise and Resubmit, or Rejected
- **Tracking submission history** and flagging changes from previous revisions

The skill produces deliverables suitable for direct inclusion in RFI responses, meeting minutes, and project correspondence.

## When to Use

- **Submittal PDFs uploaded** for review by contractors or suppliers
- **Verifying products meet specifications** before purchase or installation approval
- **Preparing review comments** for architect/engineer sign-off
- **Processing shop drawing submissions** for dimensional and detail compliance
- **Evaluating "or equal" substitutions** against original specification requirements
- **Checking certification and testing data** against spec-required standards
- **Documenting compliance decisions** in the submittal log for future reference
- **Expediting review cycles** when multiple submittals require rapid turnaround

## Data Sources

- **submittal_log** — Historical record of submitted items, spec sections, review dates, and recommendation status
- **spec_sections** — Structured project specifications with required fields:
  - `submittal_required` (boolean) — indicates if spec section requires submittal review
  - `key_req` (array) — critical requirements in natural language
  - `tolerances` (object) — dimensional and performance tolerances
  - `testing` (array) — ASTM, ASHRAE, or other standards for verification
  - `environmental` (object) — VOC, lead-free, sustainability requirements
  - `divisions` (CSI division codes) — Division 03, 05, 07, 08, 09, etc.
- **key_materials** — Material specifications database with properties, certifications, and approved equal products
- **document-intelligence skill** — Used to parse and extract data from submittal PDFs, data sheets, and shop drawings
- **project-data skill** — Used to retrieve and reference project-specific requirements and approved materials

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the Submittal
- Retrieve submittal ID from submittal_log if resubmission
- Or accept new submittal document (PDF, image, data sheet)
- Extract cover letter, item description, and submission metadata

### 2. Determine the Spec Section
- Query submittal_log by submittal ID to find associated CSI spec section
- If new submittal, ask user to specify relevant spec section (e.g., "Division 03 Concrete", "Division 08 Doors and Frames")
- Confirm with user if ambiguous

### 3. Load Spec Requirements
- Retrieve spec section from project intelligence
- Extract all relevant requirements into a structured checklist:
  - Material properties (grade, PSI, finish, color)
  - Dimensional tolerances (sizes, clearances)
  - Performance ratings (fire ratings, sound ratings, load capacity)
  - Testing standards (ASTM references with specific test methods)
  - Environmental compliance (VOC limits, lead-free, RoHS)
  - Certifications (UL, ICC, NFRC, FINEGRAIN, etc.)
- Note any "or equal" or "approved equal" clauses that allow substitutions

### 4. Parse Submittal Document
- Use document-intelligence skill to extract:
  - Product name, model, manufacturer
  - Technical specifications and properties
  - Dimensional data (from shop drawings or product data)
  - Testing certifications and lab reports
  - Material certifications and safety data
  - Installation notes and conditions
- Organize extracted data in same format as spec requirements for direct comparison

### 5. Build Compliance Matrix
- Create line-by-line comparison table:
  - Column 1: Spec Requirement (reference code, e.g., "03.03.01")
  - Column 2: Requirement Text (extract from spec)
  - Column 3: Submitted Value (extract from submittal document)
  - Column 4: Compliance Status (Compliant / Non-Compliant / Partially Compliant / Unable to Verify)
  - Column 5: Notes (explanation or citation)
- Sort by compliance status to highlight non-compliances first

### 5a. Auto-Populated Compliance Matrix
When `/process-docs` processes a submittal package, the compliance matrix should be auto-populated before the user runs `/submittal-review`:

1. From the submittal package, extract all product specifications (model, performance values, certifications, test reports)
2. From `specs-quality.json`, load the relevant spec section requirements for the material type
3. For each spec requirement, find the corresponding submitted value:
   - Match by property name (e.g., "compressive strength" in spec → "f'c" in submittal)
   - Match by ASTM standard (e.g., spec requires "per ASTM C39" → look for C39 test results)
   - Match by performance category (e.g., "fire rating" in spec → "UL listing" in submittal)
4. Pre-populate the compliance matrix:
   ```
   | Spec Requirement | Required Value | Submitted Value | Compliance | Source |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Compressive strength | ≥4,000 PSI | 4,500 PSI | ✅ PASS | Mix design report p.2 |
   | w/c ratio | ≤0.45 | 0.42 | ✅ PASS | Mix design report p.3 |
   | Air content | 5-7% | Not provided | ❓ MISSING | — |
   ```
5. Flag any row where:
   - Submitted value < required value → FAIL
   - Submitted value is missing → MISSING DATA
   - Submitted value can't be compared (different units, different test standard) → NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW

This auto-population happens during `/process-docs` extraction. The `/submittal-review` command then presents the pre-filled matrix for the superintendent to confirm, override, or supplement with field observations.

### 6. Determine Compliance Status
- **Compliant** — Submitted value exactly matches or exceeds spec requirement
- **Non-Compliant** — Submitted value falls short of spec requirement (cite specific deficiency)
- **Partially Compliant** — Submittal addresses requirement in part but leaves ambiguities or conditions
- **Unable to Verify** — Required specification data missing from submittal (request clarification)
- See compliance-checking.md for detailed determination rules and examples

### 6a. Concrete Mix Design Submittal Review
When reviewing concrete mix design submittals, use the dedicated extraction reference at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/document-intelligence/references/concrete-mix-design-extraction.md` for detailed extraction guidance. Key compliance checks:
- Design f'c meets or exceeds specified f'c (with appropriate overdesign margin)
- w/c ratio does not exceed specified maximum
- Air content within specified range (especially for freeze-thaw exposure)
- Cement type matches spec requirement (Type I, II, III, V)
- Aggregate meets gradation and maximum size requirements
- Admixtures are from approved manufacturers list (if specified)
- Lab performing trial batch is accredited
- Cold weather and hot weather modification plans are included if project has temperature-dependent specs

### 7. Generate Overall Recommendation
Synthesize compliance matrix into recommendation:

- **Approved** — All requirements met, no deviations or exceptions. Ready for installation/procurement.
- **Approved as Noted** — All critical requirements met; minor clarifications, conditions, or non-critical deviations noted. Approved with contingencies documented.
- **Revise and Resubmit** — Specific deficiencies identified. Contractor must address identified items and resubmit. Cite section references and required corrections.
- **Rejected** — Does not meet fundamental spec requirements. Resubmit with different product/approach or escalate for waiver consideration.

### 8. Draft Review Comments
- Write in professional, objective tone suitable for RFI response or meeting minutes
- Use structured comment format: [Status] | [Spec Reference] | [Finding] | [Required Action]
- Group comments by spec section or compliance status
- Include recommendations for follow-up (additional testing, certification, shop drawings, etc.)
- Cite all references to spec sections, ASTM standards, test reports
- For non-compliances, specify corrective action required

### 9. Update Submittal Log
- Record review date, reviewer, recommendation, and comments
- Link to compliance matrix and any supporting documents
- If resubmission, note previous revision status and what changed
- Flag for escalation if needed (structural engineer, code official, etc.)

## Review Comment Language Standards

### Approved
> The submitted [product/material] meets all applicable specification requirements and is approved for [procurement/installation].

### Approved as Noted
> The submitted [product/material] meets specification requirements subject to the following conditions/clarifications:
> - [Condition 1]: [explanation, deadline, or required action]
> - [Condition 2]: ...
> Approval granted pending completion of noted items.

### Revise and Resubmit
> The submitted [product/material] does not meet specification in the following respects:
> - [Reference code] [Requirement]: Specification requires [required value]. Submittal provides [submitted value]. [Specific corrective action required].
> - [Reference code] [Requirement]: ...
> Please resubmit with corrections or request formal waiver if waiver is intended.

### Rejected
> The submitted [product/material] is not acceptable due to non-compliance with fundamental specification requirements:
> - [Critical deficiency 1]
> - [Critical deficiency 2]
> Resubmit with alternative product meeting all spec requirements, or submit formal waiver request for architect/engineer consideration.

## Lead-Time Alert System

The submittal-intelligence skill tracks submittal timelines and flags items at risk of missing critical path deadlines. This system prevents procurement delays, schedule impacts, and last-minute rush approvals.

### Must-Submit-By Calculation

Working backwards from each submittal's critical path impact:

**Timeline Logic**:
1. **Activity Start Date** (from `schedule.json` → activities linked to this submittal)
2. **Minus Material Lead Time** (from procurement specs or supplier standard terms)
3. **Minus Fabrication Time** (manufacturer lead time after order placed; typically 2-8 weeks)
4. **Minus Approval Cycle Time** (architect/engineer review to approval):
   - Standard products (common, pre-approved): 2-4 weeks
   - Complex/custom products (engineered, mock-ups, samples): 4-6 weeks
5. **Minus Preparation Time** (contractor prep of drawings, samples, certifications): 1-2 weeks

**Example Calculation**:
```
Activity start date (PEMB erection): 03/23/2026
Minus: PEMB lead time: 30 days
Minus: Fabrication time: Already in PEMB lead time, covered
Minus: Approval cycle (engineered): 4 weeks
Minus: Preparation (drawings ready): 1 week
───────────────────────────────────
Must-submit-by date: 02/02/2026
```

### Alert Tiers

Three escalating alert levels based on days remaining until must-submit-by date:

| Tier | Days Remaining | Status | Action |
|------|---|---|---|
| **CRITICAL** | Past due (negative) | Red flag | Submittal missed deadline. Escalate to PM/engineer immediately. Assess schedule impact. May require expedited review or change order. |
| **WARNING** | 0-7 days | Yellow flag | Due within one week. Verify submittal ready for submission. Confirm with architect review slot reserved. Prepare expedited review package if needed. |
| **WATCH** | 8-21 days | Blue flag | Due within 3 weeks. Monitor preparation progress. Confirm no blockers (missing data, approvals, samples). Schedule architect review. |
| **NORMAL** | >21 days | Green | On track. No action needed. Continue normal schedule. |

### Daily Morning-Brief Auto-Check

The `/morning-brief` command automatically scans `submittal-log.json` and generates an alert summary:

**Query logic**:
- Find all submittals with `status` != "approved"
- Calculate `must-submit-by` date working backwards from linked schedule activities
- Compare to today's date
- Generate alert for each tier

**Morning Brief Output Example**:
```
SUBMITTAL STATUS — ALERTS ONLY (3 items at risk)

🔴 CRITICAL — Past Due
  • Nucor PEMB Reaction Drawing (SUB-008)
    Status: "under_review" (submitted 02/09, 9 days ago)
    Needed by: 02/02 (7 DAYS PAST DUE)
    Impact: PEMB erection critical path blocked
    Action: Call Nucor today; escalate to CMW architect

🟡 WARNING — Due in 3 Days
  • Schiller Door Hardware (SUB-012)
    Status: "revision_submitted" (resubmit 02/15)
    Needed by: 02/18 (3 days)
    Impact: Door procurement dependent
    Action: Confirm with architect; hold time slot for review

🔵 WATCH — Due in 18 Days
  • Davis & Plomin HVAC Equipment (SUB-015)
    Status: "under_review" (submitted 02/10)
    Needed by: 03/05 (18 days)
    Impact: HVAC procurement, MEP rough-in scheduled 04/27
    Action: No urgent action; normal tracking
```

### Submittal-Log Data Structure

For lead-time tracking, each submittal in `submittal-log.json` must include:

```json
{
  "id": "SUB-008",
  "item": "PEMB Reaction Drawing",
  "spec_section": "05 42 00",
  "submitting_sub": "Alexander Construction / Nucor",
  "status": "under_review",
  "submitted_date": "2026-02-09",
  "must_submit_by_date": "2026-02-02",
  "approval_cycle_days": 4,
  "material_lead_time_days": 30,
  "fabrication_days": 0,
  "preparation_days": 7,
  "linked_schedule_activity_id": "A45-PEMB-Erection",
  "linked_activity_start_date": "2026-03-23",
  "critical_path_blocked": true,
  "days_past_due": 7,
  "alert_tier": "CRITICAL",
  "notes": "Nucor sent initial, needs revisions for anchor bolt details"
}
```

### Rejection/Resubmission Workflow

When a submittal is rejected or returned for revisions, auto-calculate new timeline impact:

**Trigger**: Submittal status changes from "under_review" to "revise_and_resubmit" or "rejected"

**Auto-Calculation**:
1. Set new `revision_number` (increment from previous)
2. Capture original `must_submit_by_date`
3. Record `rejection_reason` from architect's comments
4. Estimate resubmission time (typically 3-5 business days for major revisions, 1-2 for minor)
5. Add resubmission lead time to today to get new `expected_resubmit_date`
6. Recalculate new `must_submit_by_date` (if 2nd revision, time is even tighter)
7. Compare new deadline to original; flag if slipping past must-submit-by
8. Alert to PM: "Resubmission due [date]. New approval cycle leaves [N] day margin."

**Example Rejection Timeline**:
```
SUB-008 PEMB Reaction Drawing (Nucor)
Original submission: 02/09
Original must-submit-by: 02/02 (MISSED by 7 days)
Rejection date: 02/12
Rejection reason: "Anchor bolt embedment depth needs verification per geotechnical report"
Estimated resubmission: 02/15 (3 days for revisions)
New approval cycle: 4 days (expedited given past-due status)
New must-submit-by: 02/19 (16 days past original deadline!)
Action: Flag to PM; assess schedule impact; consider change order if erection delayed
```

### Resubmission Tracking

Track each revision with separate entries to maintain history:

**In `submittal-log.json`**:
```json
{
  "id": "SUB-008",
  "item": "PEMB Reaction Drawing",
  "revision_history": [
    {
      "revision_number": 1,
      "submitted_date": "2026-02-09",
      "status": "revise_and_resubmit",
      "rejection_reason": "Anchor bolt embedment depth needs verification per geotechnical report",
      "rejection_date": "2026-02-12",
      "approval_cycle_days": 4,
      "must_submit_by_date": "2026-02-02",
      "days_late": 7
    },
    {
      "revision_number": 2,
      "submitted_date": "2026-02-15",
      "expected_approval_date": "2026-02-19",
      "status": "under_review",
      "approval_cycle_days": 4,
      "must_submit_by_date": "2026-02-19",
      "days_late": 17,
      "turnaround_time_days": 3,
      "notes": "Expedited review requested; geotechnical verification confirmed"
    }
  ],
  "current_revision_number": 2,
  "total_revisions": 2
}
```

### Critical Path Submittal Flagging

Cross-reference each submittal with `schedule.json` critical path to flag items that will block the schedule if delayed:

**Linking logic**:
- Submittal's `spec_section` maps to `schedule.json` material requirement
- Check if linked activity has `float` = 0 or < 5 days
- If yes, set `critical_path_blocked` = true
- These submittals get priority flagging in alerts

**Example**:
```
SUB-008 PEMB Reaction Drawing
  Linked activity: A45-PEMB-Erection (critical path)
  Float: 0 days
  Flag: CRITICAL_PATH_BLOCKED = true
  Alert priority: Highest — any delay impacts substantial completion

SUB-015 HVAC Equipment Data
  Linked activity: A72-MEP-Rough-In (near-critical, float = 5)
  Float: 5 days
  Flag: CRITICAL_PATH_BLOCKED = false (but near-critical)
  Alert priority: Medium — some schedule cushion but tight
```

### Integration with /morning-brief and /daily-report

**Morning Brief (`/morning-brief`)**:
- Scan all submittals with `status` != "approved"
- List only CRITICAL and WARNING tiers (skip WATCH/NORMAL unless requested)
- Include must-submit-by dates and linked activities
- Provide action items for each flagged item

**Daily Report (`/daily-report`)**:
- Include new rejections or resubmissions in "Open Items" section
- Note any submittals that crossed into CRITICAL or WARNING during the day
- Track turnaround time for resubmissions (days between rejection and resubmit)
- Update schedule impact assessment if critical path activities are affected
